# Overview

Using the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets), find and download a dataset to work with. Using the downloaded dataset, write a python script that reads in the data, parses it, and displays an *interesting* report.

When submitting your assignment, have a `README.md` file stating what you're producing a report on, why, and what you've learned after parsing the data.

Zip up the whole folder and email that in by the due date above.


## Example #1: 

Using the [Current Employee Names, Salaries, and Position Titles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Current-Employee-Names-Salaries-and-Position-Title/xzkq-xp2w) dataset, I could provide a report of the minimum, maximum, and average pay of city employees based on title.

## Example #2

Using the [Chicago Public Schools - School Progress Reports SY1819](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Progress-Reports-SY1/dw27-rash) and [Libraries - Locations, Hours and Contact Information](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Libraries-Locations-Hours-and-Contact-Information/x8fc-8rcq), I could produce a report to discuss the correlation of having a library by a school and better performance in school.


## Requirements
Since we're reiterating skills you learned in class, the following requirements are placed on you only to have you showcase your skillset. In a normal project environment, you'd use what is best for the project.

1. You must use a `csv` data file
2. You must use `pandas`
3. Your output can be a report to a `csv` or `txt` file, or a visualization using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (See [matplotlib-example.py](matplotlib-example.py) for an example)
